This is my personal implementation of [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html) by Peter Shirley in Rust. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
